# WinGetter

WinGetter is a PowerShell function that simplifies searching for and installing Windows software packages using the `winget` command line tool. It retrieves a list of available packages based on a user-provided search string, displays the results in a sortable grid view, and allows users to select and install multiple packages at once.

## Prerequisites

* Windows Package Manager (winget) must be installed on your system. You can download it from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases).
